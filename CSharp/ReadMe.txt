If you've made it thus far, you've probably got the koans mostly up and running in your Visual Studio IDE. Once you run the AutoKoanRunner.exe terminal, the Moradi shall give further instructions on which method to start with and what to do with the first koan.

Remember to save(Ctrl + S) everytime you perform or make changes to a koan in order for the AutoKoanRunner to build your progress. You may need to hit the save button a few times though if it doesn't start building instantly. 

Remember that there is more than one way to solve a koan. The idea is not to complete the koans as fast as you can but to work though them thoroughly and work though the various possiblities until it builds correctly. Keep in mind that if you recieve compiler errors, then the AutoKoanRunner.exe will output an exception and shall not build until the compiler error is resolved. 

In order to start the koans, navigate to DotNetKoans-master/AutoKoanRunner/bin/Debug/AutoKoanRunner.exe after you have built(Ctrl + B) the project in your Visual Studio IDE and the Moradi shall guide you towards enlightenment.
